# Custom Difficulty

If you want to customize the server difficulty that every player will use in your server, follow these easy steps!

## Step 1 - Disable custom difficulty

To ensure that custom difficulty settings are disabled, please follow these steps: 

* Running the Rimworld Together server application  `GameServer.exe`.
* Type in the console window the command: `disabledifficulty`

* Alternatively, you can locate the `DifficultyValues.json` file in your main server folder within the "core" subfolder.
* Change the value of `UseCustomDifficulty` to `false`

By doing this, you'll ensure that custom difficulty settings are turned off and the default settings are in place.

## Step 2 - Give yourself Admin permission

* Log into the server and give yourself admin permissions by typing in the server console window:
`op ''yourusername''`

## Step 3 -  Access the Storyteller selection menu

To access the in-game storyteller selection menu, follow these steps:

* Press the ESC key.
* Navigate to "Options."
* Select "Gameplay."
* Choose "Storyteller Settings."
* Click on "Modify."


## Step 4 - Change the difficulty values.

In the Storyteller selection menu, Click on the "Custom" option, where you then  adjust your values just as you would in a regular game.

* Once you've completed adjusting your settings, click the button located at the bottom right of the same window labeled "Send Difficulty" to transmit the values to the server.


## Step 5 - Enable Custom Difficulty.

* Once you've confirmed the difficulty values you wish to use, be sure to enable custom difficulty again through the server console by typing: `enabledifficulty`

* Alternatively, you can locate the `DifficultyValues.json` file in your server folder within the "core" subfolder
* Change the value of `UseCustomDifficulty` to `true`
