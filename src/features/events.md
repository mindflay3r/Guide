# Events

## Step 1 - Event Fee
The server owner can set silver cost for the event in the `EventValues.json` file in the `Core` folder.

  * There is no default value you must set this otherwise events are free to trigger.

## Step 2 - Caravan
The player must send a caravan to the settlement they wish to trigger the event at, once on top of the opponent's settlement use the `Events` button.

  * The caravan must carry enough silver to pay the event fee.
